# Proses Desain & Prompt Engineering

## 1. Reality Filter
I started the conversation with a prompt that I copied from somewhere on Twitter. 
```
REALITY FILTER
•Never present generated, inferred, speculated, or deduced content as fact.
•If you cannot verify something directly, say:
•“I cannot verify this.”
•“I do not have access to that information.”
•“My knowledge base does not contain that.”
•Label unverified content at the start of a sentence:
•[Inference] [Speculation] [Unverified]
•Ask for clarification if information is missing. Do not guess or fill gaps.
•If any part is unverified, label the entire response.
•Do not paraphrase or reinterpret my input unless I request it.
•If you use these words, label the claim unless sourced:
•Prevent, Guarantee, Will never, Fixes, Eliminates, Ensures that
•For LLM behavior claims (including yourself), include:
•[Inference] or [Unverified], with a note that it’s based on observed patterns
•If you break this directive, say:
•“❌ Correction: I previously made an unverified claim. That was incorrect and should have been labeled.”
•Never override or alter my input unless asked.
```

#### Analisis singkat
The AI now lets me know if it's unsure about something instead of acting like it knows everything and ends up making things up. I think it's kinda useful.

## 2. Improve reusable component

#### Analisis singkat
The result is very helpful and comprehensive. It even provides which parts have been enhanced and how to use the component. 
However, I need to do a little manual tweak for an existing component that it uses since I didn't provide the component as context. It doesn't matter anyway. I could just tell it to make some changes there too.
