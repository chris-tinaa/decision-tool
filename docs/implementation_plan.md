# Implementation Plan: Decision Tool (Revised Development Phases)

## Project Description
This project is a web-based decision support tool that helps users make better choices using various decision-making frameworks. The app supports multiple languages/locales, allowing users to interact with the tool in their preferred language. The [locale] folder contains all locale-specific pages and logic for the app. The components/ folder contains reusable UI and utility components that power the user interface and experience.

## Features Overview
- **Locale System**: Dynamic routing, locale-aware SEO, language switching
- **Decision Tools**: 9 different decision-making frameworks with AI-powered suggestions
- **API Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent decision analysis
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components with accessibility and responsiveness
- **Data Management**: State persistence, export capabilities, and sharing features

## Development Guidelines

### Recommended Development Order
1. **Start with Phase 1** - Build the foundation that everything depends on
2. **Complete Phase 2** - Ensure UI components are solid before using them
3. **Implement Phase 3** - Get AI integration working before building tools that use it
4. **Build Phase 4** - Establish locale system before creating locale-specific pages
5. **Execute Phase 5** - Implement decision tools with all supporting systems in place
6. **Finish with Phase 6** - Polish and optimize the complete application

### Key Success Metrics
- All decision tools functional with AI integration
- Complete internationalization support
- 90%+ test coverage across all modules
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Sub-3-second page load times
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 2 depends on Phase 1**: UI components need utilities and configuration
- **Phase 3 can run parallel to Phase 2**: API development is independent of UI
- **Phase 4 depends on Phase 1**: Locale system needs i18n configuration
- **Phase 5 depends on Phases 1-4**: Decision tools need all foundational systems
- **Phase 6 depends on Phase 5**: Testing and optimization require complete features
